# Geometry Survivors

A small game using Three.js, React Three Fiber, [Miniplex] and libraries from the [Composer Suite], exploring the following:

- Using Miniplex within React Three Fiber, but doing as much as possible within Miniplex, and outside of React;
- Doing this in a way that it still benefits from the React Three Fiber ecosystem and React primitives like `<Suspense>`.
